    Given the output of the mapper for this exercise, the reducer should PRINT 
    (not return) one line per UNIT along with the total number of ENTRIESn_hourly 
    over the course of May (which is the duration of our data), separated by a tab.
    An example output row from the reducer might look like this: 'R001\t500625.0'

    You can assume that the input to the reducer is sorted such that all rows
    corresponding to a particular UNIT are grouped together.

    Since you are printing the output of your program, printing a debug 
    statement will interfere with the operation of the grader. Instead, 
    use the logging module, which we've configured to log to a file printed 
    when you click "Test Run". For example:
    logging.info("My debugging message")
    Note that, unlike print, logging.info will take only a single argument.
    So logging.info("my message") will work, but logging.info("my","message") will not.
